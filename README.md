**ChroniumSync** aligns blockchain operations with real-world time.  
It detects timestamp anomalies, ensures transaction accuracy, and preserves the integrity of time-sensitive on-chain activity.

## 🔑 Key Features

🧩 **ChronoAlign**  
Flags transactions with timestamps that drift from actual real-world timing.

📡 **MomentTrack**  
Monitors synchronization in real-time to detect delayed or out-of-order transaction flows.

🛡 **TimeGuard**  
Identifies risky time gaps that could indicate replay attacks, delay exploits, or manipulation attempts.

🔍 **SyncScope**  
Performs ultra-precise time diagnostics — perfect for high-frequency trading or critical contract events.

🧠 **ChronoFix**  
Automatically corrects timestamp drifts and latency discrepancies without user intervention.

## 🧠 ChroniumSync AI Modules — Open Time Functions

These are the core logic functions that power ChroniumSync’s time-checking engine.  
Each one detects, aligns, or repairs timing discrepancies in blockchain transactions — ensuring sync at every level.

### 🧩 1. ChronoAlign — Blockchain Time Synchronization

```javascript
function chronoAlign(transactionData) {
  const currentTimestamp = Date.now();
  const timeDifference = Math.abs(transactionData.timestamp - currentTimestamp);
  const syncThreshold = 1000; // milliseconds

  return timeDifference > syncThreshold
    ? 'Alert: Blockchain Timestamp Misalignment Detected'
    : 'Transaction Synchronized';
}
```
#### Description: Compares transaction timestamps to current system time.
Flags outdated or manipulated entries that fall outside the allowed window.

### 📡 2. MomentTrack — Real-Time Data Alignment

```javascript
function momentTrack(transactionData) {
  const syncThreshold = 500; // milliseconds
  const alignmentScore = Math.abs(transactionData.timestamp - Date.now()) / transactionData.timestamp;

  return alignmentScore > syncThreshold
    ? 'Alert: Data Misalignment Detected'
    : 'Data Aligned';
}
```
#### Description: Calculates alignment score for transaction timing.
Detects if data is delayed, out-of-order, or at risk of causing execution lag.

### 🛡 3. TimeGuard — Temporal Risk Detection

```javascript
function timeGuard(transactionData) {
  const maxDeviation = 2000; // milliseconds
  const timeDiff = Math.abs(transactionData.timestamp - Date.now());

  return timeDiff > maxDeviation
    ? 'Alert: Temporal Risk Detected'
    : 'Time Risk Free';
}
```
#### Description: Monitors for excessive time deviation.
Flags timing anomalies used in replay attacks or latency exploits.

### 🔍 4. SyncScope — High-Precision Monitoring

```javascript
function syncScope(transactionData) {
  const allowedErrorMargin = 300; // milliseconds
  const timestampError = Math.abs(transactionData.timestamp - Date.now());

  return timestampError > allowedErrorMargin
    ? 'Alert: Precision Error Detected'
    : 'Transaction Within Allowed Precision';
}
```
#### Description: Focuses on millisecond-level precision.
Ideal for validators, bots, or systems where micro-latency matters.

### 🧠 5. ChronoFix — Auto-Correction for Time Errors

```javascript
function chronoFix(transactionData) {
  const correctionThreshold = 1000; // milliseconds
  const timeDifference = Math.abs(transactionData.timestamp - Date.now());

  if (timeDifference > correctionThreshold) {
    transactionData.timestamp = Date.now(); // Auto-correct
    return 'Correcting Time Error';
  } else {
    return 'No Time Correction Needed';
  }
}
```
#### Description: Detects significant time drift and adjusts the timestamp automatically.
Keeps transaction data in sync — no manual fix needed.

## ⏳ Final Pulse

ChroniumSync doesn’t just track time — it respects it.  
In every millisecond drift, in every delayed block, there’s risk.  
This system listens, aligns, and restores trust in the rhythm of the chain.

Because in Web3, timing isn’t technical — it’s truth.
